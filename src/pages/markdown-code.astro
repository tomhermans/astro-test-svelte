  # Markdown syntax is now supported! **Yay!**
  # Dillinger
  ## _The Last Markdown Editor, Ever_

  Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
  AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - ✨Magic ✨

  ## Features

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

  Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
  that people naturally use in email.
  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

  > The overriding design goal for Markdown's
  > formatting syntax is to make it as readable
  > as possible. The idea is that a
  > Markdown-formatted document should be
  > publishable as-is, as plain text, without
  > looking like it's been marked up with tags
  > or formatting instructions.

  This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
  for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
  watch the results in the right.
